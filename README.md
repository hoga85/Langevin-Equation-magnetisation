# Langevin-Equation-magnetisation
The presented R script aims at demonstrating the temperature dependence of magnetisation non-linearity. This temperature dependence was an issue in magnetic particle imaging, but it was also used as a method to remotely monitor the temperature of magnetic particles. This simulation was built for a literature survey for my PhD thesis, 'Remote Sensing of the Temperature during Magnetic Hyperthermia'.
